      <h1>Privacy Policy (Bite Safe)</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: February 1, 2026</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Bite Safe ("we," "our," "us") is designed to run entirely on your device.
        We do not operate any servers or intentionally collect, transmit, or store your data.
        This policy explains what data the app uses on your device and your choices.
      </p>

      <h2>Data We Use (On Device)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>User-entered data: Ingredient trigger lists you type into the app.</li>
        <li>Scanned text: OCR text from ingredient labels when you scan.</li>
        <li>App data storage: Your triggers, scan history (if any), and settings are stored locally in a SQLite database on your device.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data We Do Not Intentionally Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not require accounts or collect personal information directly.
        We do not sell data or share it for advertising.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Libraries</h2>
      <p>
        Bite Safe uses third-party libraries (e.g., OCR).
        These libraries are intended to operate on-device, but their behavior is controlled
        by their providers. We do not send your data to any servers, but a third-party library
        could independently collect or transmit data. For details, please review the privacy
        policies of the relevant providers.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party SDKs Used</h2>
      <p>
        Bite Safe includes the following third-party SDKs/libraries. They are intended for
        local, on-device use, but their providers may collect data according to their own policies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google ML Kit Text Recognition (google_mlkit_text_recognition)</li>
        <li>Image Picker (image_picker)</li>
        <li>Mobile Scanner (mobile_scanner)</li>
        <li>Device Info Plus (device_info_plus)</li>
        <li>Share Plus (share_plus)</li>
        <li>File Picker (file_picker)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing and Exporting</h2>
      <p>
        You can optionally export your data as a base64-encoded file for your own backup/restore.
        You can optionally share your trigger list with another user by generating a QR code and
        having them scan it. These actions are initiated by you; we do not receive this data.
      </p>

      <h2>Permissions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Camera (optional): Used only to scan ingredient labels or QR codes.</li>
        <li>Photos (optional): If you choose to pick an image to scan.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can control these permissions in iOS Settings at any time.</p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>All data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.</p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Bite Safe is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>If we update this policy, we will change the "Last updated" date.</p>
